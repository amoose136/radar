NOAA Weather Radar for Alfred
=============================

This is an Alfred Workflow that downloads the latest weather radar images from NOAA, compiles them into an animated gif, and displays this gif with Quicklook. It's written in python and runs reasonably fast but future versions may be faster. It should notify of updates automatically, checking for updates on standard invocation if it hasn't checked in 7 days and provides an option to intall said update automatically should it exist.
